;;
;;	sudo make install-emacs

;;
;; Then, to actually run it, add:
;;
;;	(require 'notmuch)

;; to your ~/.emacs file, and then run "M-x notmuch" from within emacs,
;; or run:
;;
;;	emacs -f notmuch

This buffer contains the results of a \"notmuch search\" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
thread giving a summary of the thread (a relative date, the
number of matched messages and total messages in the thread,
participants in the thread, a representative subject line, and
any tags).

Pressing \\[notmuch-search-show-thread] on any line displays that thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-add-tag]' and '\\[notmuch-search-remove-tag]'
keys can be used to add or remove tags from a thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-archive-thread]' key
is a convenience for archiving a thread (removing the \"inbox\"
tag). The '\\[notmuch-search-tag-all]' key can be used to add and/or remove tags from all
messages (as opposed to threads) that match the current query.  Use with caution, as this
will also tag matching messages that arrived *after* constructing the buffer.

Other useful commands are '\\[notmuch-search-filter]' for filtering the current search
based on an additional query string, '\\[notmuch-search-filter-by-tag]' for filtering to include
only messages with a given tag, and '\\[notmuch-search]' to execute a new, global
search.
