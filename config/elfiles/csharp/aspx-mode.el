;;; aspx-mode.el --- mode for editing ASPX files

;;
;; This is an emacs mode for editing single-file ASPX modules,
;; which can contain HTML, javascript, C# or VB, and
;; CSS code.
;;
;; It relies on multi-mode.
;; (see http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs )
;;
;; It provides context-sensitive fontification and indent in all of the
;; various chunks o an ASPX file. Browser-side Javascript within script
;; blocks gets fontified correctly. Server-side script blocks get
;; fontified properly. CSS gets indented and fontified. And of course
;; HTML.
;;
;; It relies on espresso for the javascript mode, css-mode for CSS,
;; html-mode for HTML, and csharp-mode 0.7.5 or later for the
;; server-side c# code.
;;
;; Bugs:
;;
;;  - The fontification sort of turns on and off as you cursor through
;;    the buffer, making for a somewhat odd user experience.
;;
;;  - the fontification sometimes doesn't happen within a chunk, til you
;;    modify the text within the chunk.  There's probably a fix for
;;    this.

Or, maybe return nil if not sure what mode it should be.
I don't know. The doc is thin and the code is impenetrable.

This method attempts to cache the calculated result and use it
intelligently.  For example if the first execution determines
that the POS is within a C# chunk, the limits of that chunk
are cached. If a subsequent invocation of this method provides a
POS that is within those limits, the function can safely return
the same chunk response, without further scanning.

This works as long as the buffer hasn't changed - in other words
it's just cursor navigation.
