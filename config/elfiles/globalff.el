;;; Commentary:

;; Start with M-x globallff and type in any substring of any path on
;; your system to display the matching files. The displayed list is
;; updated dynamically as you type more characters or delete some.
;;
;; Needs an up-to-date locate database for file name searching.
;;
;; Since the search is based on locate you can use any globbing
;; characters allowed by the locate command.
;;
;; You can move up/down the list with the cursor keys (I know these
;; bindings are not very Emacsian, but I happen to like them) and
;; select a file to open with Enter.
;;
;; You can quit with C-g.
;;
;; See the variable `globalff-map' for further bindings.
;;
;;
;; XEmacs port was done by Stefan Kamphausen.
;; Customize support contributed by Lennart Borgman and Stefan Kamphausen.
;; Camel case support added by Eyal Erez.
