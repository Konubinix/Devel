;; A signed version of this file is available over there:
;; http://www.informationelle-selbstbestimmung-im-internet.de/emacs/

;;; Commentary:
;; If you sometimes send plaintext e-mails that really should have been
;; encrypted ones, then this file may be for you.
;; I assume that you are familiar with GnuPG support for Gnus messages as
;; described in Info node `(message) Security':
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html
;;
;; The code aims for automatic insertion of MML secure tags into messages
;; if public keys (either GnuPG public keys or S/MIME certificates) for
;; all recipients are available.  In addition, before a message is sent,
;; the user is asked if plaintext should really be sent unencryptedly when
;; public keys for all recipients are available.
;; This works by rebinding `C-c C-c' and `C-c C-s' as well as by adding
;; `jl-encrypt-if-possible' to `gnus-message-setup-hook'.
;; If you are really interested in S/MIME then I suggest that you take a
;; look at jl-smime.el in addition to this file.

;; Install:
;; Place this file into your load-path and add the following to ~/.emacs.
;;     (require 'jl-encrypt)
;; In general, no further configuration should be necessary.

;; Sanity check:
;; Without any further configuration, send a GnuPG encrypted e-mail to
;; yourself as follows.  Enter your own e-mail address after To, choose some
;; Subject, and enter `M-x spook' in the body, which will insert suitable
;; text.  Then press `C-c C-c' to send the e-mail as usual (forgetting to
;; encrypt).  If you own a GnuPG public for the To e-mail address then you
;; will be asked whether you really want to send that e-mail as plaintext.
;; Answering `no' will insert an MML secure tag for you.  Press `C-c C-c'
;; again, and an encrypted e-mail will be sent.  If you receive that e-mail
;; with garbled attachments read the comment for `jl-gpg-without-mime'.

;; You may want to check the subsequent comments to understand the rationale
;; of my changes to standard message behavior.

;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Code:
(require 'gnus)
(require 'message)

;; For pgp(mime) the following variable ensures that replies to encrypted
;; e-mails are encrypted (i.e., an MML tag is inserted into the message
;; buffer).
;; However, this does not work for S/MIME encrypted e-mails.  Once decrypted,
;; they loose their encrypted property in gnus-article-wash-types.  If you
;; are interested in S/MIME, you may want to consider jl-smime.el.
(setq gnus-message-replyencrypt t)

;; Rebind keys for sending messages to check whether encryption is possible
;; (all necessary public keys are available).
;; In the past, this could have prevented me from sending plaintext e-mails
;; that should have been sent encrypted.
(define-key message-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'jl-message-send-and-exit)
(define-key message-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-s") 'jl-message-send)

;; Make gnus insert MML encryption tags if keys for all recipients are
;; available.  Thus, if you reply (or wide reply) to a message or edit
;; a saved draft, then MML encryption tags will be inserted right away.
(add-hook 'gnus-message-setup-hook 'jl-encrypt-if-possible)

(defvar jl-gpg-without-mime nil
  "Control whether MML encryption should use MIME Security with OpenPGP.
RFC 3156 specifies how OpenPGP (and, thus, GnuPG) and MIME work together.
In Gnus, `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime' follows that standard.
An alternative is `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgp', which represents a
less powerful approach.  If you (like me in the past) happen to send
e-mails in an environment using broken M$ SMTP servers, then your
beautiful e-mails produced by `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime',
following RFC 3156, will be corrupted along the way.  E.g., the SMTP
server at my department throws away the e-mail's Content-Type
`multipart/encrypted' and its `protocol=\"application/pgp-encrypted\"'
and inserts a meaningless `multipart/mixed' one.  Thus, the recipient
will have a hard time figuring out what the e-mail's strange attachments
are good for.  FUBAR.
If this variable is set to nil (the default) then your e-mails are built
according to RFC 3156.  I suggest that you send an encrypted e-mail to
yourself.  Complain to your IT department if you receive garbled
attachments.  Then set this variable to non-nil, while they are setting
up a reasonable SMTP server.")

(defvar jl-encrypt-without-signature t
  "Control whether MML encryption tags should also produce signatures.
Set to nil to produce an MML tag that signs in addition to encryption.
In general, I'm not interested in signing my e-mails.  In contrast, I
believe that off-the-record communication aims for the correct set of
security goals: Confidentiality with perfect forward secrecy, integrity,
and repudiability, see: http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/
Unfortunately, that's not an option for e-mail.")

(defvar jl-recipient-headers '("to" "cc")
  "List of headers that determine whose keys must be available.
An MML secure tag will only be inserted based on `jl-encrypt' if public keys
or certificates are available for all recipients mentioned in these headers.
Note that this list does not include From; in case of GnuPG, I recommend the
encrypt-to option in gpg.conf instead (which makes sure that you can decrypt
e-mails sent by yourself).
Also, be careful with Bcc headers; it *might* be possible to make this work
without giving away the Bcc'ed identities, but I did not test this and
recommend against such a thing: Only add Bcc if you are absolutely sure that
you know what you are doing.  And let me know how to do that properly ;)")

;; For the reason stated in the docstring of jl-encrypt-without-signature,
;; I'm not using:
;; (setq gnus-message-replysign t)

;; Moreover, I don't think that setting mml-default-encrypt-method makes much
;; sense.  The code in this file determines what method to use based on the
;; availability of public keys or certificates.  And on jl-gpg-without-mime.
;; Be sure to read its comment.
