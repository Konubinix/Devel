; This is an emacs-based interface to the notmuch mail system.
;
; You will first need to have the notmuch program installed and have a
; notmuch database built in order to use this. See
; http://notmuchmail.org for details.
;
; To install this software, copy it to a directory that is on the
; `load-path' variable within emacs (a good candidate is
; /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp). If you are viewing this from the
; notmuch source distribution then you can simply run:
;
;	sudo make install-emacs
;
; to install it.
;
; Then, to actually run it, add:
;
;	(require 'notmuch)
;
; to your ~/.emacs file, and then run "M-x notmuch" from within emacs,
; or run:
;
;	emacs -f notmuch
;
; Have fun, and let us know if you have any comment, questions, or
; kudos: Notmuch list <notmuch@notmuchmail.org> (subscription is not

This buffer contains the results of a \"notmuch search\" of your
email archives. Each line in the buffer represents a single
thread giving a summary of the thread (a relative date, the
number of matched messages and total messages in the thread,
participants in the thread, a representative subject line, and
any tags).

Pressing \\[notmuch-search-show-thread] on any line displays that thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-add-tag]' and '\\[notmuch-search-remove-tag]'
keys can be used to add or remove tags from a thread. The '\\[notmuch-search-archive-thread]' key
is a convenience for archiving a thread (removing the \"inbox\"
tag). The '\\[notmuch-search-operate-all]' key can be used to add or remove a tag from all
threads in the current buffer.

Other useful commands are '\\[notmuch-search-filter]' for filtering the current search
based on an additional query string, '\\[notmuch-search-filter-by-tag]' for filtering to include
only messages with a given tag, and '\\[notmuch-search]' to execute a new, global
search.
