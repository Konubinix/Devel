set completion-ignore-case on
set bell-style none
# If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when  performing
# case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
set completion-map-case on
set editing-mode emacs
# When  set  to On, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow
# keys.
set enable-keypad on
set expand-tilde on
# When  set  to  On,  makes  readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it
# becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.
set horizontal-scroll-mode on
set keymap emacs
# If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
set mark-directories on
# If set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of  mark-directories).
set mark-symlinked-directories on
# This  variable, when set to On, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing filename
# completion.  If set to Off, the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.
set match-hidden-files on
# If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be  empty)  before  cycling
# through the list.
set menu-complete-display-prefix on
# If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
set page-completions off
# If  set  to  On,  readline  will  display  completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the
# screen.
set print-completions-horizontally on
# This  alters  the  default  behavior of the completion functions.  If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion
# cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous.  If set  to  On,  words
# which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common
# prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
set show-all-if-unmodified on
# If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when  per‐
# forming completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline does not insert characters from the completion that match charac‐
# ters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
set skip-completed-text on
# If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended to the filename when listing  possible  comple‐
# tions.
set visible-stats on
